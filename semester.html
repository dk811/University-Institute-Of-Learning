    <h1>Why Study Abroad?</h1>
    <p>According to the Economic Times, since 2005, the total number of international students opting to study abroad has globally risen from 28,00,000 to
over 50,00,000. The desire to travel and study in the top universities of the world has only grown over the years.

There are innumerable reasons which encourage both students and their parents to opt for global education. Some of them are discussed below:-<br><br>

Globally-Renowned Education:- The most significant reason for international students to study abroad is the first-class quality of education.
No matter which field students decide to pursue, studying in a foreign country offers them a large number of outstanding opportunities in terms of learning, skill-building, and professional knowledge.<br><br>
Great Career Opportunities:- From a wide range of internships to working part-time, international students are exposed to unlimited opportunities
and experiences which are valuable for their careers and growth. After the completion of their studies abroad, students possess a high chance of
securing better and more fulfilling working opportunities.<br><br>
Cultural Exposure:- Studying overseas offers international students a lifetime opportunity to live in an entirely new country and familiarise themselves
with its culture, traditions, people, lifestyles, etc.<br><br>
Discover Yourself:- For many students, studying abroad might be the first time when they will be living on their own. This could be their only chance to
re-discover their interests and passions. Also, it involves a lot of responsibilities which can make them into a more independent and self-sufficient
individual.<br><br>
Linguistics:- Students studying in foreign countries like the USA, UK, France, Sweden, and Germany need to be fluent in their native languages.
Knowing a foreign language is always an added benefit in resumes as well as in personal lives.</p>

    <h1>What to Study Abroad?</h1>
    <p>International students can decide to study abroad at any level of their education, from a few weeks long summer programs to full-fledged degree courses.
Some of the most commonly-opted academic programs are:-<br>

Foundation and Pathways Programs: These are the post-secondary academic programs students choose to fill the gap between the current level of their
education and knowledge & skills required to pursue a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree at an international university. These programs assist in language
proficiency and familiarize students with the education system of a particular country. Foundation Programs generally target both domestic as well as
international students.<br><br>

Associate Degrees: Associate Degrees are the academic programs chosen by students at the undergraduate level. These programs provide a foundation of
technical and academic knowledge necessary to go further in a particular choice of study. The duration of these programs is usually two years.

Associate degrees are most commonly offered by US universities, however, students can also find them in several other countries such as Canada, Hong Kong,
 Australia, and the Netherlands.<br><br>

Bachelor’s Degrees: Pursuing a bachelor’s degree is one of the most common reasons why international students study abroad.
These degrees are standard programs that are recognized globally as ‘undergraduate programs’ and usually spans for 3-4 years. Students are advised to
consider this option when a particular program is not offered in their home country. This is as the cost of pursuing a bachelor’s degree is extremely high
when considering foreign universities as compared to the home country. Additionally, a master's degree from international universities has better weightage
as compared to a bachelor’s from international universities.</p>

  <h1>Where to Study Abroad?</h1>

in US universities. However, as of August 2018, Australia is also emerging as one of the favorite educational destinations with over 68,000 Indian students
studying in renowned Australian universities.
